## Python Comments

- Comments can be used to explain Python code.
- Comments can be used to make the code more readable.
- Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.

### Creating a Comment
Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:

#### Example

```
#This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")
```

Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line:

#### Example
```
print("Hello, World!") #This is a comment
```
Comments does not have to be text to explain the code, it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code:

#### Example
```
#print("Hello, World!")
print("Cheers, Mate!")
```


### Multi Line Comments
Python does not really have a syntax for multi line comments.

To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:

#### Example

```
#This is a comment
#written in
#more than just one line
print("Hello, World!")
```

Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.

Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:

#### Example

```
"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
print("Hello, World!")
```


As long as the string is not assigned to a variable, Python will read the code, but then ignore it, and you have made a multiline comment.
